# CupsGG Gambling Website v2

CupsGG website uses MERN-stack and provides a JSON REST API for clients.

## How to compile and run

- Navigate to the root directory and with NPM already installed, go ahead and run the command `npm run build`. This will build both the client and the server and compile them into a .zip file.
- Inside the .zip file you will find the `build` folder will include a compiled react application ready to be served.
- Also in the file is a folder called `server`. In there you will find a Node.js application without the dependencies installed (this is cut down the file size).
- You can install the dependencies by navigating into the server root folder and running `npm install`.
